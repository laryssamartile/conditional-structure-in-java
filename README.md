# conditional-structure-in-java
This repository is dedicated to solving a list of exercises on conditional structures using the java language

## About
The list of exercises described in the section (LIST OF EXERCISES), was solved by me for practice purposes on conditional structures using the java language.<br>

#### Goals
My goal solving this list of exercises is to fix my knowledge in the java language.

#### Justification
The justification about the repository is to share some knowledge and encourage other studants are trying to follow in the technology area.<br>
Get up and come solve this list too!!

#### Exercise 1 - Multiples | beecrowd - 1044<br><br>

Read two nteger values (A and B). After, the program should print the message "Sao Multiplos" (are multiples) or "Nao sao Multiplos" (aren’t multiples), corresponding to the read values.<br>

Input<br>
The input has two integer numbers.<br>

Output<br>
Print the relative message to the input as stated above.<br><br>

#### Exercise 2 - Interval | beecrowd - 1037<br><br>

You must make a program that read a float-point number and print a message saying in which of following intervals the number belongs: [0,25] (25,50], (50,75], (75,100]. If the read number is less than zero or greather than 100, the program must print the message “Fora de intervalo” that means "Out of Interval".<br>

The symbol '(' represents greather than. For example:<br>
[0,25] indicates numbers between 0 and 25.0000, including both.<br>
(25,50] indicates numbers greather than 25 (25.00001) up to 50.0000000.<br>

Input<br>
The input file contains a floating-point number.<br>

Output<br>
The output must be a message like following example.<br>

#### Exercise 3 - Taxes | beecrowd 1051<br><br>

In an imaginary country called Lisarb, all the people are very happy to pay their taxes because they know that doesn’t exist corrupt politicians and the taxes are used to benefit the population, without any misappropriation. The currency of this country is Rombus, whose symbol is R$. <br>

Read a value with 2 digits after the decimal point, equivalent to the salary of a Lisarb inhabitant. Then print the due value that this person must pay of taxes, according to the table below.<br>

Remember, if the salary is R$ 3,002.00 for example, the rate of 8% is only over R$ 1,000.00, because the salary from R$ 0.00 to R$ 2,000.00 is tax free. In the follow example, the total rate is 8% over R$ 1000.00 + 18% over R$ 2.00, resulting in R$ 80.36 at all. The answer must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.<br>

Input<br>
The input contains only a float-point number, with 2 digits after the decimal point.<br>

Output<br>
Print the message "R$" followed by a blank space and the total tax to be payed, with two digits after the decimal point. If the value is up to 2000, print the message "Isento".<br>
